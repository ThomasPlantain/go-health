        Get collection of outlets loops.


        An outlet loop defines an acceptance network for one or several
        products. It is especially useful to use a loop when you want to provide
        a way for the user to search outlet based on a loop instead of a
        product.

      description: >
        The Accept-Language request-header field restricts the set of natural
        languages that are preferred as a response to the request.

        It is defined by the
        [RFC7231-s5.3.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5)
        that itself relies on
        [RFC5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646) for language
        tags.

        The current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in
        September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate
        three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag
        Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and
        BCP 47

          Accept-Language = "Accept-Language" ":"
                            1#( language-range [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )
          language-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( "-" 1*8ALPHA ) ) | "*" )

        Each language-range MAY be given an associated quality value which
        represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages
        specified by that range. The quality value defaults to "q=1". For
        example,


        ```

        Accept-Language: <language>

        Accept-Language: *


        // Multiple types, weighted with the quality value syntax:

        Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5

        ```


        A language tag (which is sometimes referred to as a "locale
        identifier"). This consists of a 2-3 letter base language tag
        representing the language, optionally followed by additional subtags
        separated by '-'. The most common extra information is the country or
        region variant (like 'en-US' or 'fr-CA') or the type of alphabet to use
        (like 'sr-Latn'). Other variants like the type of orthography
        ('de-DE-1996') are usually not used in the context of this header.


        Would mean: *I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and other
        types of English.*

        Please have a look on the [RFC
        2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html) for more
        details.

                which backend to consume to retrieve information about a
                specific medium for the context of a specific business unit.


                There is no constraint about the list of available values, as it
                is too specific to each business unit. But a recommendation, to
                support potential business evolution of the media, is to reuse
                the solution product family code, followed by a number.

        It is mainly useful for technical reason, as it allows for an API
        exposing multi-products features to identify which backend to consume to
        retrieve information about a specific medium for the context of a
        specific business unit.


        There is no constraint about the list of available values, as it is too
        specific to each business unit. But a recommendation, to support
        potential business evolution of the media, is to reuse the solution
        product family code, followed by a number.

    SchemaHeaderAcceptLanguage:
      type: string
      description: >
        The Accept-Language request-header field restricts the set of natural
        languages that are preferred as a response to the request.

        It is defined by the
        [RFC7231-s5.3.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5)
        that itself relies on
        [RFC5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646) for language
        tags.

        The current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in
        September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate
        three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag
        Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and
        BCP 47

          Accept-Language = "Accept-Language" ":"
                            1#( language-range [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )
          language-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( "-" 1*8ALPHA ) ) | "*" )

        Each language-range MAY be given an associated quality value which
        represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages
        specified by that range. The quality value defaults to "q=1". For
        example,


        ```

        Accept-Language: <language>

        Accept-Language: *


        // Multiple types, weighted with the quality value syntax:

        Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5

        ```


        A language tag (which is sometimes referred to as a "locale
        identifier"). This consists of a 2-3 letter base language tag
        representing the language, optionally followed by additional subtags
        separated by '-'. The most common extra information is the country or
        region variant (like 'en-US' or 'fr-CA') or the type of alphabet to use
        (like 'sr-Latn'). Other variants like the type of orthography
        ('de-DE-1996') are usually not used in the context of this header.


        Would mean: *I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and other
        types of English.*

        Please have a look on the [RFC
        2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html) for more
        details.

                    A request was made of a resource using a request method not
                    supported by that resource; for example, using GET on a form
                    which requires data to be presented via POST, or using PUT
                    on a read-only resource.

                    The request entity has a media type which the server or
                    resource does not support. For example, the client uploads
                    an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that
                    images use a different format.
